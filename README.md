# Jasmine JS-Reporter

This is a Jasmine Reporter, designed to simplify the extraction of test results from the Page.
It's tailored with _Test Reporting Automation_ in mind.

Ideal scenario of use are:

* Use Selenium Web Driver to extract the result out of the page
* Use PhantomJS to do... well, the same as above
* Every time you wish Jasmine produced a JSON to report about the tests

## What does it do?

The Reporter awaits for all the Test to finish, than produces a report that can be retrieved with

```javascript
var JSONReport = jasmine.getJSReport ();
// or
var strJSONReport = jasmine.getJSReportAsString ();
```
and looks like the following:

```JSON
{
    "suites": [
        {
            "description": "Simple test that checks the obvious regarding Truthy-ness and Falsy-ness",
            "durationSec": 0.005,
            "specs": [
                {
                    "description": "should report that a number is truthy, if different than '0', falsy otherwise",
                    "durationSec": 0.004,
                    "passed": true,
                    "skipped": false,
                    "passedCount": 3,
                    "failedCount": 0,
                    "totalCount": 3
                },
                // ... more specs here...
            ],
            "suites": [],
            "passed": true
        }
    ],
    "durationSec": 0.005,
    "passed": true
}
```

After that, you can just extract it from the page.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository, and include the reporter in your page running Jasmine tests:
    * `<script src="path/to/jasmine-jsreporter.js" type="text/javascript"></script>`
2. Tell jasmine to use the reporter
    * For Jasmine 1.x: `jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new jasmine.JSReporter())`
    * For Jasmine 2.0: `jasmine.getEnv().addReporter(new jasmine.JSReporter2())`
3. Run your tests as normal
4. Go to your browser console, via [WebInspector](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/WebInspector), [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com/), etc.
     On the console, type:
     * `jasmine.getJSRepor t()`
5. Check that you get an Object back (should look like the above one)
6. You are done!

Now you can setup your Test Infrastructure to _extract test results from the test page_, in the same way I just showed you.

## Examples

I have provided some usage examples:

* `examples/`
    * `phantomjs-javascript/`: Example use with PhantomJS [WORK IN PROGRESS]
    * `selenium-java/`: Example use with Selenium in Java [WORK IN PROGRESS]
    * `spec-runner/`: Example HTML page that uses Jasmine and JS-Reporter - open the WebInspector/Firebug
